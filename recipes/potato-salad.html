        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for Old-Fashioned Potato Salad instructs you to boil unpeeled potatoes in salted water until they're tender but still firm. You'll drain them and let them cool a bit, then peel and chop into bite-sized pieces. (Boiling helps the potato skins slip off easily.) Depending on how large your potatoes are, boiling could take between 10 to 15 minutes or more. Start testing for doneness at about 10 minutes by piecing a potato with a sharp paring knife. If it slides in easily all the way to the center of the potato, the potato is cooked and ready to drain.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 potatoes</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and chop.</li>

            <li>While potatoes cook, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.</li>

            <li>Combine the potatoes, eggs, celery, onion, relish, mayonnaise, mustard, garlic salt, celery salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix together well and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
